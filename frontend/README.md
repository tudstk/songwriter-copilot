signal is a user-friendly music sequencer application developed using web technology, designed for seamless, cross-platform use.

## Goals

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure accessibility across various devices and operating systems.
- **Simple User Interface:** Focus on an intuitive, non-complicated user interface for ease of use.
- **MIDI Compatibility:** Support for MIDI format to facilitate a wide range of music production needs.

## Concepts

signal is conceptualized not as a replacement for a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), but as a complementary tool. It excels during the initial stages of music composition and sketching, allowing artists to quickly and efficiently lay down their musical ideas. To keep the focus on composition without distractions, signal comes with intentional limitations:

- **Basic Sound Quality:** Prioritizes simplicity over high-quality sound production.
- **No Effects (Fx):** Excludes sound effects to streamline the music creation process.
- **Lightweight Design:** Optimized for minimal resource usage, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.

By setting these constraints, signal aims to offer a streamlined and distraction-free environment, ideal for artists focusing on the core aspects of musical composition and idea development.
